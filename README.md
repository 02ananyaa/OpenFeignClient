# OpenFeign & Apache Superset  

## OpenFeign  
OpenFeign is a declarative REST client in Spring Boot that simplifies making HTTP requests to other microservices. It eliminates the need for `RestTemplate` by providing an interface-based approach. It integrates with Eureka for service discovery and supports logging, retries, and custom headers.  

## Apache Superset  
Apache Superset is an open-source business intelligence (BI) tool for data visualization and dashboarding. It supports multiple databases, offers an interactive SQL editor, and allows users to create charts and dashboards without coding.
